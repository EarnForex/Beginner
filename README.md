# Beginner

Beginner is an indicator for MT4 and MT5 by EarnForex.com. It is a very simple indicator, which is meant to be a practice point both for indicator developers and for traders who need some objective markup of the past local maximum and minimum levels on the chart (for support and resistance, for example).

It displays the tops and bottoms with colored dots directly in the main window of the chart.

**WARNING!** This indicator repaints - it means that its current and some of the most recent output values may change as the new data arrives. It cannot be used to receive direct trading signals. Its only purpose is to learn to code other indicators and to detect repainting indicators.

![Beginner shows perfect top/bottom detection for past data but is likely failing with the most recent bottom it displays](https://github.com/EarnForex/Beginner/blob/main/README_Images/beginner-repainting-indicator-mt4-mt5.png)
